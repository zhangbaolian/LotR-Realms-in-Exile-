 language_quenya_desc:0 "The dominant [elven|E] language of the [uttermostwest|E], Quenya can be split into three dialects: Valinorean, Vanyar and Exilic.\n\nValinorean Quenya is the dialect originally spoken by the [noldorelves|E], and after the Exile preserved by those who remained in Valinor.\n\nVanyarin Quenya is the dialect spoken by the Vanyar of Valimar. It is the dialect with the most Valarin influence, yet otherwise the most conservative of the dialects, since they were less innovative than the Noldor.\n\nExilic Quenya (also known as Noldorin Quenya), was spoken by the [noldorelvesexiles|E]. This was the dialect of Quenya which saw the greatest change, and the dialect of Quenya taken by the [dunedain|E] of [numenor|E] and later the [realms_in_exile|E].\n\nThe language of the Teleri of Valinor, Telerin, is sometimes considered a branch of Quenya."
 language_westron_desc:0 "Westron, or Adûni, is a creole language of Adûnaic and the languages of the Middle Men of [middleearth|E]. Westron was formed in the northern colonies of [numenor|E], where Adûnaic was viewed as tainted by the [faithfulshort|E] due to its association with the [kingsmen|E]. As a result, there was little attempt to preserve the language, causing it to evolve more due to this neglect.\n\nFollowing the [downfall|E], the exiles of Númenor enlarged and enriched Westron with many [elvish|E] loanwords, mostly from Númenórean Sindarin. Due to the influence of the [dunedain|E], Westron became known as Common Speach in the Westlands due to its popularity, with [dwarves|E], [orcs|E] and [elves|E] speaking the tongue itself or a closely related dialect."
 language_goblin_name:0 "半兽人"
 language_orcish_name:0 "奥克语"
 language_orcish_desc:0 "While [orcs|E] do not have a unified language structure, they do indeed share the practice of composing their daily speech from corrupted borrowings from the languages of [middleearth|E], with Westron and Black Speech being the most common languages they borrow for the Orcish speech. The variations in Orcish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, as different tribes would adapt to the languages of the peoples that surrounded them. In particular, the western orcs often used Westron as their tongue between tribes on account of this."
 language_black_speech_desc:0 "黑语由黑暗魔君[sauroncharacter|E]在[secondage|E]创造，旨在成为他奴仆的通用语言。黑语被[middleearth|E]的智者们认为是黑暗而邪恶的语言，少有人敢于说出这一语言，因此，在索隆的影响范围之外，很少有人使用他它。"
 language_taliska_desc:0 "Taliska was the shared ancestral tongue of the Houses of Bëor and Hador. During their migration westward, the tongue was influenced by both the Avarin and the Dwarven Khuzdul. By the time the two tribes arrived to Beleriand, their tongues had diverged significantly, with Bëorian Taliska incorporating far more Elven elements than Hadoric Taliska.\n\nThe Bëorians largley abandoned their own branch of Taliska upon settling in Beleriand, adopting Sindarin. As a result, it would be Hadoric Taliska which would survive and evolve into the later tongue of [numenor|E], Adûnaic."
 language_adunaic_desc:0 "阿督耐克语是哈尔能河以南的前[numenorean|E]殖民地所操的语言，衍生自[firstage|E]伊甸人的塔利斯卡语。这种语言在[akallabeth|E]后逐渐演变，一些独立的[realms_in_exile|E]——如[bellakar|E]和阿纳瑞克——接受了外来影响，形成了本地方言，而另一些[adunai|E]国度——如[thanihazad|E]和坦图拉克——则更加保守的坚持其语言传统。\n\n阿督耐克语可以分为四个不同的分支，即北支、中支、南支和东支：\n\n北支：[umbarean|E]阿督耐克语，最为接近努门诺尔的高等阿督耐克语，即使如此也受到了北阿佩桑语的影响。\n\n中支：贝拉卡尔阿督耐克语，其又可细化为南北两系，北系受泰德津影响较多，南系受博兹什纳鲁德影响较多。\n\n南支：卡拉督奈克语，为沙尼‑哈扎德和[anbalkumagan|E]所使用，是最文化保守的方言，但也受到南阿佩桑语的影响，它同时也是坦图拉克所操的方言。\n\n东支：阿纳瑞克方言，只在城镇地区被使用，是最有影响力的阿督耐克方言之一，受到强烈的佉文化影响。"
 language_gwathuirim_name:0 "格瓦夙伊语"
 language_sindarin_desc:0 "Named after the [sindarelves|E] [elves|E] of [beleriand|E], Sindarin was the 'common tongue' of the Elves of the [westlands|E] of [middleearth|E].\n\nRelated to the Telerin tongue of Valinor, Sindarin developed in Beleriand during the [yearofthetreesage|E]. After the return of the [noldorelvesexiles|E] to [middleearth|E], Elu Thingol, king of the Sindar, banned the usage of Quenya in his domains. While this proclamation had little practical power to bind the Noldor, the Elves of Beleriand were also slower to learn Quenya than the Noldor Sindarin. As a result, Quenya slowly fell out of use and became a language of lore, with Sindarin becoming the dominant elven tongue.\n\nThe establishment of [sindarelves|E] kingdoms in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lothlorien|E] caused the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Nandor Elves of Lórien to adopt Sindarin. The Sindarin of [greenwoodshort|E] integrated many Silvan elements, forming a unique dialect.\n\nThe Númenóreans of Andustar adopted Sindarin for their daily speech, being descendants of the Bëorians, who had abandoned their own native dialect of Taliska. This gave birth to the [numenorean|E] Sindarin dialect, which survived in Gondor and Arnor following the Akallabêth."
 language_rhovanic_desc:0 "The Rhovanic rose from the northern group of Taliska speaking Edain who remained in [greenwood|E] in [rhovanion|E] instead of crossing the [mistymountains|E], yet the Rhovanian tongues would also be influenced by the Baradhrim tribes that came from the East in the [secondage|E], such as the Igath. Rhovanian was recognised by the Kings of [gondor|E] as similar to Westron, sharing Taliska as a common ancestor, and thus the [northmen|E] of Rhovanion were recognised as Middle Men, friendly to Gondor. The Rhovanian tongues have also influenced the languages of many peoples of Rhovanion, such as the [longbeard|E] [dwarves|E] and the Ioriags."
 language_rohirric_desc:0 "Rohirric is the language spoken by the Rhovanorim who followed Marhwini into exile to the [anduinvale|E] who became the [eothed|E] peoples. The Rohirric language is derived from the [northmen|E] tongues of Rhovanion and therefore it is classified as one of the Middle Men languages due to its similarity to Westron, sharing the common ancestor of Taliska. Over the recent years, the language has influenced the tongues spoken in the lands surrounding the Isen river, with the Adornaen people speaking a mixture between Rohirric and Gwathuilach due to their connection to [rohan|E]."
 language_avarin_desc:0 "Avarin is the exonym given to the languages spoken by the [elves|E] that refused to take the Great Journey to [valinor|E] or [beleriand|E] and remained in the lands of [cuivienen|E]. Little is known about the Avarin tongue, yet it is related to the other Elven tongues through the common ancestor of Primitive Quendian. When the Avari split, their language did so as well, with three major branches being formed; North, East and West.\n\nDue to its proximity to the [eldar|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the West Avarin dialect shared some similarities with the languages of the Silvan elves, such as loanwords.\n\nThe Eastern Avarin dialect was the most spoken of the dialects, due to the majority of the Avarin migrating East with some of them  being the ones that migrated to the far south.\n\nThe Northern Avarin dialect is the most peculiar of the lot, having no intial consonant groups, it is considered the most isolated of the dialects, with some even doubting its existance."

 language_hobbitish_name:0 "霍比特方言"
 language_hobbitish_desc:0 "Hobbitish, also known as Kudugin, is the dialect of Westron spoken by the halflings of the Shire. The language was adopted after the end of the Wandering Days, when their migration into Arnor brought them into contact with Westron, the Common Speech, which they begun speaking with loanwords from their old tongue, which had been influenced by the Rhovanian tongues, therefore, the Hobbitish tongue shares many linguistic similarities with the Northern tongues."
 language_hillmen_name:0 "蒙能特语"

 language_kurr_name:0 "窟耳语"
 language_kurr_desc:0 "Kúrr is an obscure [orcish|E] tongue spoken by some isolated tribes in the Yellow Mountains. It is comprised of sharp, snappy sounds that are spit out in quick succession, forming very crude sentences. Due to the strongly echoing caverns, simple signals and commands can travel vast distances deep beneath the earth. Because of their highly tribalistic tendencies, even neighbouring groups of Orcs have difficulty understanding with eachother."
