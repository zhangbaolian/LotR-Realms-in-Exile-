It was cursed by the gods with unending thirst, never to be sated. So it sought out life where it could, to drain the springs and rivers of [harad|E]. A great many tribes were sundered until the Windlord heard the peoples' cries and chose a champion, brave and resolute, to face the demon. His champion's name was Tarik and he was a legendary swordsman - In combat, he wielded three scimitars, and no foe had ever escaped his blade. Blessed by the Windlord with unending resolve, he set out to face the creature and to bring it to ruin, guided by a great eagle along his path. After many days of travel, he finally found Razarac in the ruins of a great city. Mere days ago it was a bustling metropolis, now ruined by its' evil.\n\n'Face me, Destroyer!', called Tarek, for he was a man of few words and many blades. Razarac glared at him with disgust and silence, for its throat had long dried out and it was unable to speak. A great battle ensued, and Tarek swiftly engaged his foe,  cutting his foe with blades swift as the wind. They fought fiercely, from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn. The demon struck with the might of earth and thunder and it's hide was fierce and coarse as sand. But Tarek's strikes were quick, precise, and, like a scorpion's, always found a weak spot. Eventually, he had worn down Razarac enough to land a finishing blow. He felled it and pierced it's foul heart, destroying its mortal form. But the creature was cunning and with its last rattling breath, whispered it's spirit into the sandy winds, where he knew no mortal could harm it.\n\nBut the Windlord had seen this coming and had his eagle whisper the true name of the winds into Tarek's ear, allowing him to pursue the demon. And so, wherever Razarac's vile spirit rests to regain his strength, Tarek is sure to soon follow and engage in combat once more in a great cycle. Their divine duels appear to us as the great sandstorms that bring drought and destruction. They are fiercest in the dunes where Razarac's form was felled, in the eternal battlefield now known as the Dune Sea, as the Mirror of Fire."

It adresses us with a series of sighs and gestures:\n\nFirst, it raises its arms, showing us the frozen landscape around it. Then, it raises its thumb to its forehead, before pointing at us and then at its belly. This is its territory, we tresspass here and must pay it tribute.\n\nIt is clear that it is hungry, and intends to fill its belly one way or another. My entourage is clearly terrified of the huge beast and look to me for guidance."
