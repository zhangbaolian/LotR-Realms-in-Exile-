 dwarven.0340.desc:0 "Eldberk, a mere ten winters into his life, witnessed the departure of his father to the fierce War of Dwarves and Orcs. Alas, his father found his final rest in a distant realm, denied the solace of a proper burial. A lingering bitterness took root within Eldberk's heart, for his uncle, Uri VI, returned from that grim conflict, while his father did not.\n\nDriven by a thirst for both renown and retribution, Eldberk embarked upon a daring venture alongside a fellowship, determined to reclaim the once-grand Mansion of Nogrod. Yet, fate had woven a cruel tapestry, for the Halls now lay submerged beneath unruly waters.\n\nNevertheless, the flame of ambition burned undiminished in Eldberk's breast. To emerge triumphant from the depths of adversity would not only quench his vengeful yearning but also carve his name into the annals of Dwarven lore."

A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the south-east is a band of orcs, bows and swords in their hand. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though Dwarves may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many.
