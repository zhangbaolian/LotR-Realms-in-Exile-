Before a great sandstone mountain chain and deep within a sinkhole is the Ogladalo Vatra, the Mirror of Fire. The salt flats of the ancient, dried lake have no equal in Middle-earth, so broad and unvarying it is. It was once known in memory and in guiding dreams as Lake Uhtyaarâ, the seasonal waters that flow in from the mountains retain that name.\n\nDeep beneath the mountains and broken terrain are ancient fossil waters tapped through cracks in the surface by the people who dwell near the mirror. Extraction happened at an industrial scale, when once the kingdom of Abrakhân was wealthy with trade, grand norias gathered water from the lake and from underground. Without those norias, the Mirror of Fire would support no life at all.\n\nThe salt of the Ogladalo Vatra is deadly to all life, used as a poison in the courts of Abrakhân and a fitting execution is salt mummification. The impossible difficulty travelling from the markets of the Far East and Distant Lands to the cities west of Lake Uhtyaarâ in Abrakhân and Dârsalan has evaporated trade. And merchants are more likely to travel the long way around Abrakhân."

In distant, ancient times, these people dwelt on the rim of Lake Uhtyaarâ, before it was a dried Mirror of Fire, and there they made their camps and fared not often into the lush lakeside.\n\nFrom these times comes a dream of a boy who killed an ancient spirit-scorpion with the help of an old man. The man wanted to taste the scorpion meat, and he devoured the inner flesh of it in little time. The young boy wanted the adamantine chitin, a portion of which made his glittering armour as a new king of the lake men and mountain men, the rest he threw into the desert sands before the mountains, freeing Lake Uhtyaarâ from whatever evil presence dwelt there.\n\nMany Sandmen tribes descended from the red-orange sedimentary mountains of the south and east, collectively they were known as the Covshek Pûst. Those who settled the ancient lake and source of the Nâfarat River were collected into a trade empire, as it was the hub of all Middle-earth trade at the time.\n\nThe Pûst are innovative, developing aquaponics to feed a great amount of people, floating gardens growing vegetables. And when water resources from the lake became exhausted, the Pûst resorted to pulling out of the ground the fossil waters of the underworld.\n\nAt some point in the past the splendour of Abrakhân beside Lake Uhtyaarâ has fallen, trade networks moved west towards Rây at the river’s delta, and the Nâfarati tribes, warlike invaders from the south with a mystic and blood seeking culture, have taken the fertile lands of the Nâfarat River, disconnecting Abrakhân to Rây. To enact revenge, Abrakhân has occasionally fielded Nâfarati shock knights and marauders armed with great maces against the Râyan people. These tribes are also well known to use the megafauna of the jungles of the south, bringing both beast and bird alongside their mercenary companies for the use of the rulers of Abrakhân."
