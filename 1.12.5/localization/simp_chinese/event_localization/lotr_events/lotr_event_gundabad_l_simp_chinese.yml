 gundabad.0200.desc:0 "For far too long, the Orcs of the North have forgotten their past. They wander about not different with wild dogs, only to be helplessly slaughtered by the men that have grown in strength since the mishap at Dale! Guided by the great Ulûkai and the blood of Azog that grants [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] great power and wit so desperately needed, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameRegnal] has once again cemented Orcish supremacy in the Anduin Vale.\n\nNow that we finally established secure control over the various bridges and fords across the Anduin, the wrath of Mount Gundabad will be felt by all throughout the North. Already warg riders are scouting for potential targets. May our raids swiftly befall any who dare to oppose us, men or elves!"
 gundabad.0200.a:0 "Great terror shall ride forth from Gundabad once more!"
 gundabad.0201.t:0 "北地之主"
 gundabad.0201.desc:0 "Bolg's folly was more than avenged when the Orc horde overran not only the Mannish kingdom of Dale, but also laid waste to the damned Greenwood. Now truly broken, the vile Men and Elves are on the run, their strongest fortifications laid low by our great trolls, their people scattered to be the prey of wild beasts and warg riders, and their riches emptied all for the lord of Gundabad. With this newfound wealth, our boys could certainly use some fresh meat instead of maggoty bread, amongst other things.\n\nNow that the Tarks will be without any assistance from the North, the eventual assault on Minas Tirith seems all the more imminent. Let them tremble in fear, for their inevitable doom is coming!"
 gundabad.0201.a:0 "Our lordship over these lands shall ensure for a hundred generations!"
 gundabad.1001.t:0 "谁才是老大"
 gundabad.1001.desc:0 "My decisive show of strength has finally brought the northern reaches of the Anduin Vale under my control, but already the local menfolk grow restless and are beginning to resist their rightful overlords. The war-hungry warriors of my host are eager to tear the heart out of this foolish resistance just as it starts beating, relishing the prospect of plunder and bloodshed that it would bring.\n\nYet there are some among the menfolk that are weak, cowardly and corruptable, who may be able to keep their people in line if given the chance to rule over them."
 gundabad.1001.a:0 "Give them control over what land I have taken."
 gundabad.1001.b:0 "Let them have it all, I need my best for the wars ahead!"
 gundabad.1001.c:0 "There is no place left in this world for men!"
 gundabad.1001.d:0 "我没时间听这些……"

 gundabad.1011.t:0 "龙之韧性"
 gundabad.1011.desc:0 "在征服灰色山脉拜龙教徒的战役中，我们鏖战许久，收货颇丰。我们得到了旧日的宏伟战旗，古代武器和数不清的金银财宝。\n\n但随着这场战争接近尾声，我竟才发现了真正配得上我丰功伟绩的宝贝。我的手下在搜索一个古老的洞穴，追杀残兵败将时，竟发现了一处过去的战场。起初我们觉得这里没什么东西，但深入搜寻后，竟发现了一座拜龙教神殿。在神殿的祭坛上摆放着一件壮丽的盔甲，它是由[dragons|E]脱落的鳞片制成的，看起来绚丽多彩。\n\n这是个预兆！象征我强悍的力量，更象征我的光辉未来！"
 gundabad.1011.a:0 "如今我就是统治群山的巨龙！"
 artifact_dragon_armour:0 "龙鳞盔甲"
 artifact_dragon_armour_desc:0 "这种粗糙而坚韧的鳞甲是半兽人铁匠用脱落的龙鳞锻造而成。龙鳞虽然质地坚硬，却富有弹性，这种盔甲与同类金属盔甲相比抗打击能力不相上下，甚至更强而且更轻盈。虽然想要生产这种盔甲困难而又艰辛，但显然是值得的。因此，拥有这种盔甲的奥克或半兽人都极其珍视，一般作为家传宝物。"

 gundabad.0202.t:0 "Ignite the Forges of [GetTitleByKey('d_gundabad').GetNameNoTier]"
 gundabad.0202.desc:0 "The mountain thunders with the meeting of hammer and anvil. The forges of the [dwarves|e], which have lay dormant for countless years, awaken.\n\nDeep under they labor day and night, producing war materials worthy of my army. As I walk through the forges, I see weapons and armor fit for war-trolls piling up, sharp blades glinting in torchlight and broad shields and breastplates emblazoned with my sigils.\n\nThe ignited Dwarven forges of Gundabad have now made it possible to produce stronger and more durable steel, suitable for my trolls and the fiercest of the warriors of Gundabad."
 gundabad.0202.a:0 "No army will be able to stand against me now!"
